He instead vouched for veteran lineman Dan Moore Jr., who has 34 starts in two seasons with Pittsburgh.<\/p>\n<p>Jones, however, is already exceeding the expectations of at least one teammate, it would seem.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"speakable-content\">Broderick Jones getting first team reps at left tackle for Pittsburgh Steelers<\/h2>\n<p>To almost nobody\u2019s surprise, Jones is getting first-team reps at left tackle for the Steelers.<\/p>\n<p>Fresh off two straight national titles at UGA, Jones was one of the most highly regarded prospects at his position in years. He will now be tasked with protecting Kenny Pickett in the pocket as Pittsburgh embraces a new era following Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Dan Moore, meanwhile, is taking reps at right tackle. A notable change in position, but not the demotion one might\u2019ve feared when Jones\u2019 name was called on draft night.<\/p>\n<p>As for Kevin Dotson\u2026 he is actually facing a demotion. Free agent\u00a0Isaac Seumalo is expected to take snaps from Dotson at left guard. A cruel twist of the ironic knife.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Dotson was never actually criticizing Jones or making grand proclamations. Offhanded comments on podcasts can easily be taken out of context and it\u2019s better to view his sentiments as confidence in Moore, not as being explicitly jealous of Jones.<\/p>\n<p>But, by that same token, it can be hard for veteran players to accept an influx of young talent, especially when teams like Pittsburgh are prioritizing player development over winning games. Dotson started all 17 games for Pittsburgh last season. Now, if healthy, one has to expect Jones will start all 17 games for the Steelers in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>To rub salt in the wound, Seumalo \u2014 on the verge of replacing Dotson \u2014 spoke very glowingly of his new teammate Broderick Jones.\u00a0From Steeler Nation:<\/p>\n<p>The Steelers should expect big things from Jones. He succeeded at the highest level of college football. Now, he\u2019s ready to tackle the pros.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pittsburgh Steelers rookie Broderick Jones is already proving teammates wrong.\u00a0 The\u00a0Pittsburgh Steelers\u00a0selected DT Broderick Jones from Georgia with the 14th pick in April\u2019s NFL Draft.
